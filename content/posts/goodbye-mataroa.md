As of today I have moved the handful of articles I had published on https://nektro.mataroa.blog/ off and transferred them back here as well as updated my GitHub profile to point back to this site. Now this isn't to say I'm going to stop using the site entirely, not by any means. I think its great and when I'm in a better financial position I might even start donating.

What changed is that I realized is that I really like using Git for deploying my site and having it on my own domain but I didn't like the experience of using Git/Vscode to actually write the articles and keep drafts. For me, Mataroa serves this purpose perfectly and then I can make a new Hugo post, paste in the markdown, and be off to the presses in no time.

I'll also take this time to mention that the reason I fell off writing "status update" posts is because like many others I was laid off from my software job back in January. This along with a string of events that coincided with the weeks following really made my motivation to write take a hit.

More recently I've been getting a bit back into a groove and I have some projects and articles in the works that I should be able to share more about soon. So stay tuned for those!

Until next time ðŸ‘‹
